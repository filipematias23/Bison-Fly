# Bison-Fly
Bison-Fly is the NDSU Spring Wheat UAV Pipeline developed in partnership with Drone2Phenome UAV community (D2P). In this pipeline we are presenting step by step how we have been applying UAV data on our breeding program. This is a open source R code from where anyone can use and adept for different crops. All suggestions are welcome. Help us to build this platform in partnership with Drone2Phenome community.
